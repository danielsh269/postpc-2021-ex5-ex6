Which UX flow will you define?
I will define a button with pencil icon.

1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage?
its really easy to figure out this flow in first usage because its a common sign for editing.
2. how hard to implement will your solution be?
its not hard at all. i will need to add this button to the ItemHolder class and to the xml, and
add a click listener that will open the keyboard and let edit the TextView of the description.
3. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?
i think its consistent with the regular "edit" flow in the Android worlds because i know it will
be obvious to me (as a user) to understand it because this edit flow appears in many apps.
